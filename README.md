KinectTheWeb
============

__KinectTheWeb__ aims to redefine how we interact with our web browser and web pages by using the Microsoft Kinect sensor in lieu, or in addition to, your standard mouse and keyboard. Its goal is to conceive, prototype, and test different interactions with the device's many sensors to attempt and enhance how we browse the ever growing WWW. 

Another related goal is to develop web pages that better facilitate and handle these type of interactions. Today's modern web pages are designed with the user in mind. Their ideal user sits behind a screen with a mouse and a keyboard. This project's additional and related goal is thus to try and rethink the web page in such a manner that is usable when other types of interaction(s) are employed.

_This idea and project is experimental in nature; its definitiion may change and take many different forms over time. KinectTheWeb is an experiment to attempt and redefine, or build another layer on top of, how we interact with the web in 2013._
